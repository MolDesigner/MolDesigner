## Hi there! I'm Luis Angel Urdez Rojas ðŸ‘‹
About Me

I am a chemistry student at the Faculty of Chemistry, Universidad AutÃ³noma de QuerÃ©taro, Mexico. My main focus is on drug design and synthesis, particularly working with cheminformatics, optimization of synthetic routes, and natural ligand analysis.I have experience using computational tools such as ChemAxon, ChemPy, and Python to perform chemical calculations, molecular modeling, and simulations. I am also interested in LaTeX, data structures, file manipulation, and molecular docking.

Skills & Tools
- Programming: Python (cheminformatics, data processing, automation)
- Computational Chemistry: ChemAxon, ChemPy, molecular docking tools
- Scripting & Automation: File handling (CSV, JSON), data manipulation
- Scientific Writing: LaTeX for documentation and research papers
- Molecular Modeling & Drug Design: Analysis of bioactive compounds, ligand-receptor interactions

Current Projects:
- Optimization of synthetic routes for potential MRP4 inhibitors
- Analysis of natural ligands to identify novel drug candidates
- Development of cheminformatics scripts to assist in molecular screening and analysis
- Learning advanced Python concepts to improve efficiency in data processing
